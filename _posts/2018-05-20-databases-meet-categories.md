This week we will:
 - talk about free categories over graphs
 - present a view of relational databases as categories
 - introduce path equations in category diagrams
 - reflect about the poset reflections of a category
 - talk about functors and natural transformations through databases
coming to 3.3.5 if everything goes as planned. 

There seems to be lots of things to go through, but it's mostly 
examples and I'll try to skip unneeded rambling where possible!

Whoever picks to do the presentation next week, gets to do adjoints for real!

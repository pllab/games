### Roleplaying Session Planner

We like roleplaying games, and we're not picky. We wanted to try a little bit of everything, so we decided to do short-term campaigns of 4-8 weeks per system. Anyone interested can join any future installment (if the host deems that there's space)!

Previously played:
+ **Stars without Number** (host: Ben Hardekopf)
> The year is 3200 and mankind's empire lies in ashes. The Jump Gates fell six hundred years ago, severing the links between the myriad worlds of the human diaspora. Now, the long isolation of the Silence falls away as men and women return to the skies above their scattered worlds. Will you be among them once more? Stars Without Number is an old-school-inspired game of sci-fi adventure, one built from the ground up to encourage sandbox play and simplify a GM's job in providing it.
+ **Fiasco** (host: Burak Kadron)
> Fiasco is inspired by cinematic tales of small time capers gone disastrously wrong – inspired by films like _Blood Simple_, _Fargo_, _The Way of the Gun_, _Burn After Reading_, and _A Simple Plan_. You’ll play ordinary people with powerful ambition and poor impulse control. There will be big dreams and flawed execution. It won’t go well for them, to put it mildly, and in the end it will probably all go south in a glorious heap of jealousy, murder, and recrimination.

Currently playing: 
+ **Blades in the Dark** (host: Burak Kadron)
> Blades in the Dark is a tabletop role-playing game about a crew of daring scoundrels seeking their fortunes on the haunted streets of an industrial-fantasy city. There are heists, chases, occult mysteries, dangerous bargains, bloody skirmishes, and, above all, riches to be had — if you’re bold enough to seize them.

Future plans include:
+ **Godbound** (host: Miroslav Gavrilov, accepting 2-3 more players)
> The Throne stands empty. Heaven has fallen, and the Words of Creation thunder from new throats. Undestined, unfettered, unchosen, you are Godbound, and your will is writ with fire. Godbound is a game of divine heroes in a broken world, men and women who have seized the tools that have slipped from an absent God's hands.
+ **The Sprawl** (host: Mehmet Emre, team not yet assembled)
> Deniable, professional, and ultimately disposable. In The Sprawl, you play the extended assets of vast multinational corporations, operating in the criminal underground, and performing the tasks that those multinationals can’t do, or can’t be seen to do. The Sprawl takes the framework of Vincent Baker’s award-winning Apocalypse World engine and focuses it on creating stories about badass professionals living outside the law, struggling against the man, sometimes winning, 

Distant future ideas:
+ **13th Age**
+ **Star Wars: Edge of the Empire**
+ **Dragon Age**
